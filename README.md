# Train-Station

This is a train scheduler application that incorporates Firebase to host arrival and departure data. This app retrieves and manipulates schedule information with Moment.js and provides up-to-date information about various trains, namely their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station.

The app simulates the user as a train station manager. The user can enter information regarding any train, click submit button, and the results will be displayed in the current schedule, along with next arrival of the train and how many minutes it is away. All calculation are handled with Moment.js
